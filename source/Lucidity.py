# @section About Lucidity
# Lucidity is software for performing digital music.  It allows the DJ to mix in both
# realtime and to lay out their mixes a bit in advance.  Lucidity is an uncompromising
# approach to digital media, and aims to take full advantage of the laptop as a
# performance tool.
#
# The fundamental idea behind Lucidity is that the DJ is planning their mixes out
# a bit in advance, but not too much.  The amount of preparation time spent in the
# software itself is minimal, allowing you to focus instead on the music.  The interface
# resembles a software sequencer, but behaves much differently.  Place the music on the
# grid, and moves left to the playhead.  While the track is playing, you have time to
# find your next several tracks and lay them out on the grid.  Effects and filtering can
# be applied to your transitions in advance, but still manipulated in realtime.
#
# Navigation in Lucidity is designed to be simple and quick, and allows for powerful
# MIDI mapping in comfortably customize the software.  Lucidity's end goal is to be
# fluid and invisible; an unobtrusive way to play digital media with infinite
# possibilities.
#
# @section Main Window
# Lucidity has only one window, and does not have tabs, hidden views, or any unseen
# user interface elements.  What you see on the main screen is what you get.  Other
# windows, such as those used for configuring channels or browsing for music, appear
# as pop-up overlays which are dismissed with the escape key (ESC).
#
# The main window has three sections: a toolbar, the channel grid, and the browser bar.
